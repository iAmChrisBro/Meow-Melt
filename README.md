**LogLine:**
A cat named [Player's Choice] is struggling financially and can barely afford to buy food.

**GamePlay:**
Meow Melt is a 3D platformer strategy game played online with a keyboard and mouse.
Players deliver ice cream across an island-like platform while avoiding falls and obstacles.
Completing 5 deliveries on time speeds up the game and increases the number of
deliveries. Failed deliveries cost money, but power-ups are available to assist players. The
player has to find a way to get to the destination in different ways while obstacles are in
the way.

**Technology:**
The technical risk would be the npcâ€™s (non-playable character) for interaction. Another
technical risk would be implementing the inventory where we would want to click and
drag to use the item.

**Story:**
Desperate, the cat decides to visit a local restaurant and dive into the dumpster to find
something to eat. However, the restaurant's owner, a gruff walrus named Mr. Zenuck
catches them in the act. Instead of kicking them out, the walrus offers a deal: if the cat
wants the food, they'll have to work for it. The cat must now tackle various obstacles and
make the deliveries on time to afford their food. Failure
